                    <p>The future has hope and the future always favors the hard working soul. Shubham Kumar, from a small town in Bihar, like all other youngsters wanted to make a name for himself. It’s just that he didn’t know ‘how to do it’ and also was concerned with lack of funds to pursue his dreams. He belonged to a very poor family but that didn’t deter him from thinking big.</p>
                    <p>He came in contact with Safeducate through his friends. Safeducate, after understanding his situation and his desire to make it big, recommended his name in Pradhan Mantri Education Loan Scheme for Poor. His name was shortlisted and he received the course loan approval from the Prime Minister of India, Modi Ji.</p>
                    <p>Highly motivated from the loan program, he studied hard and successfully cleared the course. He got placed in one of the leading logistics companies in India, Gati Logistics, as an operation Executive.</p>
                    <p>He has successfully cleared the education loan and is highly grateful to Safeducate for the overall guidance and support he received to realize his dreams.</p>

                    <p>If determination is the key to achievement, then definitely Bhupendra is the name who accomplished his desire through this opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Bhupendra Patil, one of the participants from the Certificate in Logistics Excellence (CLEx) course, enrolled with a lot of confusion in his mind, as he had no knowledge about the industry as well as skilling. He was very clear about his goals and knew the key ingredient to achieve the goal was to seize the opportunity coming his way. But gradually classroom training and the extensive practical classes helped him understand the various topics. With his perseverance and hard work CLEx course was effortlessly absorbed by him.</p>
                    <p>Bhupendra, today is placed with Naxer Logistics as Hub Manager, with the responsibility of looking after the warehousing activities. He has never looked back since then as he believed in the famous saying “Time and tide waits for none”. A constant source of inspiration for many, Bhupendra attributes his success at the workplace to the Trainers at Safeducate. He is happy with the decision he had taken which opened the door of opportunities for him. We wish him the very best in all his endeavors.</p>

                    <p>For Geeta, a girl with humble background, it was difficult to pursue her studies after matriculation. However the Deen Dayal Upadhay Grameen Kaushalya Yojna, the flagship skill development project of Government of India’s Ministry of Rural Development has opened new opportunities for millions of Indian youth from rural areas like her.</p>
                    <p>During an interaction with Safeducate’s rural mobilization team from Sikar learning centre, Geeta and her parents learned about the government funded skill development programs which can open up a new chapter in her life. The course enabled Gita to acquire new skills like effective communication, customer service, merchandise handling, etc through intensive classroom &amp; practical training and internship.</p>
                    <p>After the successful completion of the short-term course in Retail, one of the leading names in India’s Retail sector, Pantaloon hired her as a Sales Executive. The skill course not only empowered Gita to earn her livlihood but also respect and independence. For her fellow village girls, Gita is a role model to look upto and get inspired.</p>

                    <p>Although, Kamrup, a place famous for its rich cultural heritage and historical importance, apart from few small scale establishments based on handicrafts, has hardly any big industries to provide employment to its youth. Most of them after their schooling migrate to other states in search of livelihood. This is where a project like Deen Dayan Upadyay Grameen Kaushalya Yojna has played a crucial role in the life of millions of under privileged youths in rural areas. The project ensures the skill development of the youth through short-term training on a particular job role which has demand in the industry and provide job once the student completes his course successfully. Safeducate, the champion employer organization for Ministry of Rural Development, has played an important role in shaping the future of thousands of youth in many states through DDU-GKY project.</p>
                    <p>A hard working youth, Kanai Das firmly believes that failure does not last forever and any failure should be used as a stepping stone to success. Safeducate’s field mobilizers from Kamrup centre, during a community outreach met Kanai Das and explained the benefits of the skill courses. The residential program enabled him to learn about logistics industry and processes, communication skills and computer skills. After completing the training, he was selected by Safexpress to work in its Guwahati Hub, which is the largest logistics park in north east India. Kanai recommends Safeducate and DDU GKY as the platform to all those who are willing to work hard, get out of their comfort zone and make a career. He has been a star performer at his workplace and sets an example for all of them who wish to join a skill course. Safeducate Team wishes him a successful and a bright future.</p>

While his friends joined MBA to pursue their career in marketing, finance, etc, Rajesh was yet to make up his mind about his choice for specialization.
